      <p>I became a celebrant in November 2023. After performing my first
      wedding for two very close friends, I quickly realised how special - and
      how much of an honour - it is to be part of someone’s big day.</p><p>I was
      instantly drawn to working with couples to ensure their ceremony is
      exactly how they imagined it. Working closely with each couple has shown
      me that everyone’s story is unique, but the one thing they all have in
      common is the desire to celebrate their love with the people who matter
      most.</p><p>I have performed intimate ceremonies with only a handful of
      guests, as well as larger celebrations where everyone travels from near
      and far to share in the love.</p><p>I’d love to be a part of your big day
      - get in touch, and let’s see what we can create together.</p>
