blurb: >-
  Not many people get to marry their special someone amidst a state of emergency
  (the worst weather event recorded in Dunedin), but Kate made it happen! Our
  special day was intimate and memorable! Waves crashing, rain pouring, and a
  world for just the two of us; the whole beach to ourselves with Kate and our
  witnesses.   Clad in a rain jacket and gum boots, Kate held my umbrella and
  delivered a heartwarming, short and sweet ceremony. To be able to take age-old
  sentences and make them unique to one couple is true talent. We will always
  cherish Kate, and highly recommend!
