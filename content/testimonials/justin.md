  We had the most incredible time with Kate as our celebrant! It meant so much
  that we got to be your very first married couple, especially after being
  friends with you for such a long time. You brought just the right mix of
  officialism and humour, which was exactly what we wanted for our special day.
  Even though our ceremony was small, with only five people, you made it feel so
  meaningful and memorable. We’re so thankful you were such a big part of it
  all; we honestly couldn’t have asked for anyone better.
