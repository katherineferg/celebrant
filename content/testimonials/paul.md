  We are so grateful that Kate officiated our wedding in November 2024. From the
  very beginning, she made us feel comfortable and took the time to truly
  understand our vision for the day. Her words during the ceremony were
  heartfelt and beautifully captured our story, making the moment unforgettable
  for us and our guests. We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect wedding
  celebrant and wholeheartedly recommend Kate to anyone looking for a warm,
  thoughtful, and genuine presence on their wedding day.
